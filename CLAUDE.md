# MyAsset+ — Asset Tracker

> **Renamed "Smart Me" → "MyAsset+" (2026-06-27)**: app name updated everywhere — `<title>`, login header, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `manifest.json` `name`/`short_name`, and GAS ping + Telegram test-alert strings (`gas/Code.gs`). New wallet app icon from `assets/icons/M+ V7.svg` — exported PNGs (favicon 16/32, `apple-touch-icon` 180, PWA 192/512) live in `assets/icons/`, 1024 master at `assets/icon-source.png`. The SVG rasterizes onto an **opaque white** background, so the white was **flood-filled to `#f6e9cf`** from the corners (leaving the off-white "M+" lettering intact) rather than alpha-flattened. App `theme_color`/`background_color` (manifest) + `<meta name="theme-color">` are also `#f6e9cf`. SW cache `myasset-v77`. See **"App icon"** section.

## What this is

A personal finance PWA for 2 users (partners). Tracks US stocks/ETFs, gold, cash (savings/FD/FCD), insurance, private investments, Thai bonds, mutual funds, and loans/receivables (money lent out — tracked but excluded from net worth). AI-powered portfolio analysis, DCA planning, and Telegram notifications via Google Apps Script + Claude API.

> **Mutual Funds — fully rebuilt 2026-06-20** — Phase 1 (manual NAV, insert-only) + Phase 2 (daily auto-refresh) + fund-name search complete. See **"Mutual Funds — rebuild plan"** at the bottom.
> **NAV source order flipped 2026-06-25**: NAV refresh is now **Tier 1 Finnomena by `fund_code`** (freshest, no key, widest coverage) → **Tier 2 SEC by `sec_proj_id`** (official fallback) → Tier 3 manual. Also: adding a fund with an auto source now kicks a **fire-and-forget** NAV refresh so its card flips 🟡→🟢 within seconds instead of waiting for the 8PM trigger.
> **Daily Tech-News brief + Analysis page (2026-06-26)**: New holdings-aware morning brief — `NotificationAgent.sendDailyNewsBrief()` (7AM trigger `onNewsBriefTrigger`) uses Claude's **server-side `web_search` tool** to find today's tech/market news, flags stories about tickers the user holds with 🎯, sends via Telegram, and **persists** to `daily_news` + `daily_news_impact` (migration 021). The **Analysis tab** now reads those tables to show a browsable, sentiment-colored news history (date selector + 🎯 holdings / 📊 market sections), with the DCA/review hub kept below as "Tools". **Depth is decoupled**: Claude returns the full ~8-12 stories (all persisted to the page); Telegram is capped to a scannable top 6 with a "+N more" footer. See **"Daily Tech-News brief"** + **"Analysis"** sections.

> **Asset logos (2026-06-27)**: Brand logo icons next to every `$ticker` (holdings tables + Ticker Detail modal) and a generic fund icon on MF cards — same dual `src/config/*.js` + inline-`const` pattern as the bank logos. US-stock logos from `ticker-logos`, ETFs mapped by **fund issuer** (Vanguard/Schwab/JPMorgan/Invesco/BlackRock), crypto + gold from `nvstly/icons`. Each logo sits in a circular badge whose background is chosen per-logo (white / dark / fill) from measured brightness so contrast is right in **both** themes; unmapped tickers fall back to a colored initials badge. See **"Asset logos"** section.

> **Loan page — receivables (2026-06-27)**: New **Loan** page under the Asset hub for money the user lends OUT (migrations 022 + 023). `loans` + `loan_payments` (installment schedule, FK cascade). Per-loan cards (remaining, progress bar, next payment, status badge) → detail view with a payment-schedule checklist. **Partial payments**: `paid_amount` is a cumulative running tally; per-row status derived as paid / **partial (orange)** / overdue / pending; "Record Payment" adds to the tally (prefilled with the remaining due). **Per-row editable due dates** (inline date picker, independent — never shifts the rest). **DELIBERATELY excluded from net worth** — shown only on its own summary + an "outstanding · not in net worth" Asset-hub row; nothing wires into `calcUserData`/donut. SW cache `myasset-v79`. See the **Loans** rows in the DB tables, Pages, and Key functions sections. ⚠️ Run migrations 022 + 023 in Supabase.

> **DCA simulator in Ticker Detail modal (2026-06-29)**: New "จำลองซื้อเพิ่ม · DCA Simulator" card below Quick Stats in the Ticker Detail modal — simulate adding to a position before buying. Amount input + preset chips ($50/$100/$200/$500) recalc **live** (no submit) and show Current → After for Shares / Avg Cost / Value / P/L %, with an avg-cost delta badge (↓ green when DCA pulls the average down). **Only renders for tickers the user actually holds** (looked up in `_portTableData`). Pure client-side math, no DB/GAS calls. SW cache `myasset-v80`. See the **Ticker Detail modal** bullet in Key functions. No migration.

> **Insurance — detailed policy tracking (2026-06-29)**: Rebuilt the Insurance page into a full policy record (migration 024). `insurance_policies` extended with `policy_type` (Endowment/Unit Linked/Whole Life/Other), `policy_number`, `insured_name`, `status` (in_force/lapsed/matured), `policy_date`, `premium_mode` (annually/semi-annually/quarterly/monthly) + `premium_amount_thb` (per-payment), `payment_method`, `next_due_date`, `last_payment_date`/`_amount_thb`/`_method`, `notes`, `created_at` — **product name reuses the NOT-NULL `policy_name`**; legacy `annual_premium_thb` + `surrender_value_thb` stay but are no longer read. Page = summary (active count, annual premium commitment = Σ premium×freq for in-force, ⏰ due-within-30-days highlight) + per-policy cards (type badge, status dot, sum-assured/maturity/premium/next-due grid, "Last paid" line, edit/delete) + add/edit modal. Added anon insert/update/delete RLS. **⚠️ Insurance is now DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED from net worth** (informational only) — removed from `calcUserData` (no longer queried), the home donut segment, and `loadMore`'s subtotal; the Asset-hub row now shows total annual premium with an "Informational · not in net worth" sublabel (loans-style). SW cache `myasset-v83`. See the **Insurance** rows in DB tables, Pages, Key functions. ⚠️ Run migration 024 in Supabase.

> **MF "Guess code from fund name" helper (2026-06-30)**: New 🔍 button under the **Fund code** field in the MF add/edit modal — searches **Finnomena** by the typed fund name (falls back to a partial code in the field) and shows a tappable list of share classes; tapping fills `fund_code`, which the existing fire-and-forget refresh turns into a live NAV on save. Finnomena's search is strongest on **code fragments / short names** (full English names return fuzzy hits) — fine here since funds are often named by their code (e.g. holding `fund_name = "TGSMARTRMF-A"`). New GAS action `mfGuessCode` → `DataAgent.searchFinnomenaFunds(q)` (`…/funds/v2/public/funds/search?q=`, no key, never throws → `[{short_code, name_en, name_th, active}]`); frontend `guessFundCode()`/`_pickFundCode()` mirror the SEC-search pattern, reusing the `.mf-search-row*` styles. No migration. SW cache `myasset-v84`. ⚠️ Paste `gas/DataAgent.gs` + `gas/Code.gs` into the Apps Script IDE and redeploy the Web App, else the button returns "Search failed".

> **MF cards now show AMC logos (2026-06-30)**: Replaced the generic black fund glyph on Mutual Fund cards with the issuing **AMC** (asset-management company) logo, derived from the fund-code/name prefix by `_mfAmc(h)` (KKP→kkp, KT-→ktam, ES-→eastspring, 1AM-/ONE-→one, PRINCIPAL→principal, UOB→uob, TISCO/TG/TE→tisco, K-→kasikorn). `AMC_LOGOS` map (inline in `index.html` + mirrored in `src/config/assetLogos.js`) → `assets/logos/amc/*.png`. Five bank-affiliated AMCs **reuse the bank brand logos** (copied from `assets/banks/`: KKP, KBANK→kasikorn, TISCO, UOB, KTB→ktam); **Eastspring** = its double-chevron mark (cropped from Wikimedia Commons), **Principal** = the white-P gradient tile (principal.com apple-touch-icon, rendered `tk-fill`). Per-AMC badge style via `AMC_LOGO_DARK` (kkp = pale logo → dark badge) / `AMC_LOGO_FILL` (principal). **Fallback: an AMC with no sourced logo (ONE Asset Management — only a low-res wordmark exists) renders a colored initials badge** (`_tkBadge`, same as unmapped stock tickers) — text from `AMC_LABEL[amc]` so all of an AMC's funds share one badge (ONE → "ON"), never a broken/blank slot. `_fundLogoImg(h, size)` takes the holding; `_fundBadgeLabel(h, amc)` picks the badge text (AMC label → AMC key → fund code). `fund.svg` is no longer referenced. 21 of 23 holdings show a logo; the 2 ONE funds (1AM-DAILY-RA, ONE-DISC-ASSF) show the "ON" badge. No migration. SW cache `myasset-v86`. See **"Asset logos"** + **"Thai AMC logos"**.

> **Bigger bottom-nav touch targets (2026-06-30)**: Enlarged the 6-tab bottom nav for comfortable mobile tapping. `.nav-item` now `min-height:52px` + `justify-content:center` (whole icon+label block is a ≥44×44px touch target), padding `8px`→`12px`, icons `20px`→`25px`, label font `9px`→`10.5px`, gap `2px`→`4px`; `#bottom-nav` padding-bottom `var(--safe-bottom)`→`calc(var(--safe-bottom) + 6px)` (more clearance above the iOS home indicator). To keep the taller bar from overlapping content, the reserve was bumped `80px`→`96px` in both `.page` bottom padding and the `#toast` offset. CSS-only, no JS/markup change (single shared nav → applies to every page). No migration. SW cache `myasset-v87`.

> **Benchmark Comparison — last tab on the US Portfolio page (2026-07-02, moved from Analysis 2026-07-02)**: The **US Portfolio** page's tab strip now ends with a **📊 Benchmark** tab (after every portfolio tab). It plots your portfolio's growth against **NASDAQ (`^IXIC`)** and **S&P 500 (`^GSPC`)**, all **normalized to 100 at the first date** (index comparison, so % return is directly comparable regardless of scale). Controls: a **portfolio pill selector** (multi-select — `Total` + one pill per portfolio, auto-emoji via `_bmEmoji`: 🤖 AI / 🌍 ETF / 🚀 Growth / 💰 Dividend; selecting specifics combines their holdings into one cyan line), a **Timescale** segment (minute `1m` / hour `1h` / **day `1d` default**), and a **Timeframe** segment (1M/3M/**6M default**/1Y/YTD). Chart.js line chart, 3 dashed lines — NASDAQ yellow `#eab308`, S&P teal `#14b8a6`, portfolio cyan `#22d3ee` — index-mode tooltip showing `value (±%)` for all lines, custom bottom legend. **Portfolio line** = Σ(shares × historical close) per date across selected portfolios, from `holdings` × Yahoo daily closes. **New GAS action `benchmarkHistory`** (`_yahooChart(symbol, range, interval)`) returns `{ SYMBOL: {t:[unixSec],c:[close]} }` for a comma-sep symbol list — a thin, never-throwing Yahoo `/v8/chart` proxy. Frontend aligns series by UTC-date bucket (daily) / raw ts (intraday), forward/back-fills gaps, normalizes. `1m` interval is clamped to a `5d` range (Yahoo's minute-data limit). The tab is a `.tab-btn` in `#portfolio-tabs`; `showBenchmarkTab(btn)` sets it active and injects `_bmMarkup()` into `#portfolio-content`, then `initBenchmark()` (caches `_bmPorts`, keeps the pill selection across tab switches). No migration. SW cache `myasset-v92`. **⚠️ Paste `gas/Code.gs` into the Apps Script IDE and redeploy the Web App**, else the chart returns "โหลดข้อมูลไม่สำเร็จ". See the **Benchmark** rows in GAS actions + US Portfolio Key functions.

> **DCA Plan — multi-portfolio + manual execution tracking (2026-07-03)**: Rebuilt the DCA Plan page from a single Growth-only, GAS-generated approval list into a **per-portfolio planner the user drives by hand** (migration 025). **One plan per portfolio per month** (`dca_plans` gains `portfolio_id`; unique now `(user_id, portfolio_id, month_year)`; frontend now WRITES plans + items → anon insert/update RLS added). Page = a **month selector** dropdown (history, defaults to current month) + **portfolio tabs** (built from `portfolios`, auto-emoji via `_bmEmoji`), each tab independent. Per tab: header (month · **status pill** DRAFT→IN PROGRESS→COMPLETED · **DCA budget** input `$` comma-formatted · **🔄 Refresh**), a summary line (`N/M tickers completed · Planned $ · Actual $`), a table **TICKER · Reasoning · Suggested · Planned · Actual · ✓**, and a progress bar. **Refresh** runs the gap-from-target logic client-side (`_dcaGenerate`: lists **all holdings**, but only **underweight** tickers share the budget proportionally by gap — overweight ones show reasoning `At/above N% target (+x%)` and no-target ones `No target % set`, both with Suggested `—` yet still manually plannable; sorted so suggested rows lead; Suggested is non-editable, recalculates on Refresh) and **preserves** Planned/Actual/Done per ticker (`_dcaSyncItems`). **Planned/Actual** are editable inputs, **✓** a checkbox — all persist to `dca_plan_items` (new cols `planned_amount_usd`/`actual_amount_usd`/`is_done`; `suggested_amount_usd` relaxed to nullable/default 0). Status is **derived** from items (`_dcaDeriveStatus`) and mirrored to the DB. A **"+" button** next to the month selector (`_dcaAddNextMonth`) seeds a blank plan for the month after the newest (budget carried from prior month, no tickers) and jumps to it. **Two email buttons** (`#dca-complete-wrap`) → **GAS action `dcaEmailSummary`** → `DCAAgent.emailMonthSummary(userId, month, mode)` builds a per-portfolio plain-text summary (per-ticker **✅ done / 🔄 in progress / ⬜ not started**; subject `… (X/Total completed)`) and `MailApp.sendEmail`s it to **chanika.cptk@gmail.com** (no OAuth — GAS runs as owner): **📧 Submit & Email Summary** (`_dcaSubmitEmail`, `mode='submit'`) is **always shown** (any month with items) and does NOT change status; **✅ Complete Month** (`_dcaCompleteMonth`, `mode='complete'`) appears only when every ticker across ALL portfolios is ticked and additionally flags every plan `completed`. Globals `_dcaMonth`/`_dcaPortId`/`_dcaPorts`/`_dcaMonths`; helpers/CSS prefixed `_dca*`/`.dca-*`. SW cache `myasset-v96`. **⚠️ Run migration 025 in Supabase** + **paste `gas/DCAAgent.gs` + `gas/Code.gs` into the Apps Script IDE and redeploy the Web App** (else the email button returns "Unknown action"). `MailApp.sendEmail` adds a **new Gmail send OAuth scope** — the first save/deploy after pasting prompts the owner to **re-authorize**; run `emailMonthSummary(<userId>,'YYYY-MM')` once from the IDE to trigger the consent screen before relying on the button. See the **DCA Plan** rows in DB tables, Pages, Key functions, GAS actions, and migrations.

> **Ticker Detail modal → tabbed layout (2026-07-02)**: Rebuilt the Ticker Detail bottom-sheet from one long scroll into a **TradingView-style tab bar** below the price header — **Overview · Technicals · News · Earnings · Simulator** (horizontal scrollable pills, `.td-tabbar`/`.td-tab`, active = `--accent`). Only the active tab renders into `#td-tab-content` (`_tdShowTab`); shared state in `_tdCtx`, per-tab data **lazy-loaded**. **Overview (NEW)** — key-stats list (volume, avg volume 30D, market cap, dividend yield, P/E TTM, EPS TTM, net income FY, revenue FY, float, beta 1Y, 52wk H/L) from a **new GAS action `getOverview`** → `_yahooOverview` → Yahoo **v10 `quoteSummary`** (`_yahooQuoteSummary` + cookie/crumb via `_yahooCrumb`, cached in ScriptCache; every field null-safe). **Technicals / News / Simulator** are the existing widgets, unchanged, just relocated under their tabs. **Earnings (NEW, added 2026-07-03)** — next earnings date + last-4-quarters EPS actual/estimate + revenue with a Beat/Miss badge, from a **new GAS action `getEarnings`** → `_yahooEarnings` (Yahoo `quoteSummary`) with a **Claude web-search fallback** (`_claudeEarnings`) when Yahoo is empty. No migration. SW cache `myasset-v92`. **⚠️ Paste `gas/Code.gs` into the Apps Script IDE and redeploy the Web App** (run `testOverview()` / `testEarnings()` there to confirm Yahoo reachability), else the Overview/Earnings tabs show "ไม่สามารถโหลดข้อมูล…". See the **Ticker Detail modal** bullet in Key functions + the `getOverview` / `getEarnings` GAS actions.

## Deployment

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "..."
git push origin main   # GitHub Pages auto-deploys in ~60s
```

**Always bump `sw.js` cache version** (`myasset-vN`) when `index.html` changes.  
`index.html` is served **network-first** by the SW — a normal refresh picks up changes after deploy.

**If a deploy doesn't appear** (seen 2026-07-02/03): the `pages build and deployment` Action can build the artifact fine but then **hang in the deploy step** (`Current status: deployment_queued` → `Timeout reached, aborting!`), leaving the live site on the previous version — even while [githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com/) shows Pages "operational" (it lags real incidents). **The nasty part: a hung deploy stays "in progress" server-side and holds the Pages lock**, so the *next* deploy fails instantly with `400 — Deployment request failed … due to in progress deployment. Please cancel <sha> first`. Recovery that actually worked (2026-07-03):
> 1. **Stop all concurrent triggers** — kill any background poll/retry loops; concurrent Pages builds cancel each other (`##[error]Deployment cancelled`), making it look broken when it isn't.
> 2. **Cancel the stuck lock** the error names: `gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages/deployments/<STUCK_SHA>/cancel` (returns empty/204). Find the culprit sha in the failed run log (`gh run view <id> --log-failed | grep "in progress deployment"`).
> 3. **Trigger exactly one build** (`gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages/builds`, or a single empty commit) and **watch only** — don't re-trigger while it runs.
>
> Verify with `curl -s <live>/sw.js | head -1` (expect the new `myasset-vN`) and `gh run list`. Only one Pages deployment runs at a time, so a stuck run blocks all new ones. Remember the app is a PWA: after the deploy lands, a home-screen icon still needs the app **fully closed & reopened twice** (1st launch installs the new SW, 2nd serves it) to drop the old cached shell.

## Authentication

Custom PIN auth — **not** Supabase Auth. `users` table stores `pin_hash` + `salt`. Session in `localStorage` as `{ userId, userName, partnerId }`. Auto-restores on load.

`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is intentionally hardcoded in `index.html` — it is the publishable key only. **Never put `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in index.html.**

### RLS pattern
- All tables: `anon_read_all` SELECT policy (frontend filters by `user_id` in JS)
- Frontend (anon key) can write: `holdings`, `portfolios`, `watchlist`, `cash_accounts`, `gold_holdings`, `dca_plan_items`, `private_investments`, `private_holdings`, `thai_bonds`, `mutual_fund_holdings`, `insurance_policies`, `loans`, `loan_payments` (the latter scoped by parent `loan_id`, not `user_id`)
- `bond_master`, `daily_news`, `daily_news_impact` are read-only for anon; GAS writes them via service_role
- GAS uses `service_role` key (bypasses RLS entirely)

## GAS setup

Files are copy-pasted into Apps Script IDE — not auto-deployed from this repo.

> **⚠️ Publishing a new GAS action requires redeploying the Web App — and the clicks matter** (bit us 2026-07-03 with `getOverview`/`getEarnings`): pasting/saving code in the IDE, or running a `testX()` function from the editor, does **NOT** update the live Web App. The frontend calls the *deployed* URL, which keeps serving the old version until you publish — so a new action returns `{ok:false, error:"Unknown action: …"}` and the feature silently shows its "unavailable" state. To publish: **Deploy ▸ Manage deployments ▸ ✏️ Edit the existing deployment ▸ Version: New version ▸ Deploy** (Edit, *not* "New deployment" — a new deployment mints a new URL the app doesn't know). URL is unchanged. Confirm with `‹exec-url›?action=getOverview&symbol=O` in a browser (expect JSON with `overview`, not "Unknown action").

**Script Properties:**
| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `https://zchwqmykjjjtoaymuvwx.supabase.co` |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | service_role key |
| `CLAUDE_API_KEY` | Anthropic key |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token |
| `NEWSAPI_KEY` | NewsAPI.org key |
| `SEC_API_KEY` | SEC Open Data subscription key (secopendata.sec.or.th → กองทุน section) |

**Deploy as Web App**: Execute as Me → Anyone. Save URL in app Settings page (`app_config` table).

**Run `setupTriggers()` once** from GAS IDE:
- Daily @ 7AM → `onNewsBriefTrigger` (holdings-aware Tech-News brief via Claude `web_search` → Telegram; `atHour(7)` uses project TZ — set it to **Asia/Bangkok**)
- Daily @ 8AM → `onDailyTrigger` (weekdays: fetch → analyze → news → notify; monthly on day 1; weekly on Monday)
- Every 5 min → `onRealtimeTrigger` (crypto/gold ±5%, S/R proximity ±1%)
- Daily @ 8PM → `onMFNavTrigger` (mutual-fund NAV refresh; `atHour(20)` uses project TZ — set it to **Asia/Bangkok**)

## GAS web app actions

Called from frontend via `callGAS(action, params)`:

| action | handler |
|---|---|
| `fetchData` | DataAgent.fetchAll() |
| `analyzeAll` | AnalystAgent.reviewAllPortfolios() |
| `analyzePortfolio` | AnalystAgent.reviewPortfolioById(portfolioId) |
| `generateDCA` | DCAAgent.generatePlans() |
| `fetchNews` | NewsAgent.fetchForAllHoldings() |
| `updateSRLevels` | DataAgent.updateDynamicSRLevels() |
| `getPrice` | Yahoo Finance single quote |
| `getHistory` | `_yahooHistory(symbol)` — 6-month daily **closes** + `price`, `prevClose`, `week52High/Low`, best-effort `marketCap`/`peRatio` (v7 quote, degrades to null). Backs the **Ticker Detail modal** technicals gauge (RSI/SMA/MACD computed client-side). Never throws |
| `getOverview` | `_yahooOverview(symbol)` — key stats for the Ticker Detail **Overview** tab (volume, avg volume, market cap, dividend yield, P/E TTM, EPS TTM, net income, revenue, float, beta). Uses `_yahooQuoteSummary` (Yahoo v10 `quoteSummary`, modules `summaryDetail,defaultKeyStatistics,financialData,price`) which needs a cookie+crumb pair from `_yahooCrumb` (fc.yahoo.com → `/v1/test/getcrumb`, cached ~30 min in ScriptCache). Returns raw numbers; every field degrades to null and never throws. `testOverview()` in the GAS IDE verifies reachability (O, AAPL) |
| `getEarnings` | `_yahooEarnings(symbol)` — next earnings date + last-4-quarters EPS actual/estimate + revenue for the Ticker Detail **Earnings** tab. Yahoo `quoteSummary` (`earnings,earningsHistory,calendarEvents`) via `_yahooQuoteSummary`; **falls back to `_claudeEarnings`** (Claude `web_search`) only when Yahoo returns nothing. `{ nextDate, nextDateIsRange, currency, quarters:[{label,epsActual,epsEstimate,revenue,revenueEstimate}], source }`; never throws. `testEarnings()` verifies (O, AAPL) |
| `getGoldPrice` | DataAgent.fetchGoldPrice() — live spot, saves to DB, returns `{price, source}` |
| `savePrice` | DataAgent.savePrice() |
| `searchTicker` | Yahoo Finance search |
| `testTelegram` | send test message |
| `sendNewsBrief` | NotificationAgent.sendDailyNewsBrief() — generates + sends the daily holdings-aware Tech-News brief now (manual trigger for testing) |
| `dcaEmailSummary` | `DCAAgent.emailMonthSummary(userId, month, mode)` — builds a per-portfolio plain-text DCA summary (per-ticker ✅/🔄/⬜ + Planned/Actual + grand total; subject `… (X/Total completed)`) from `dca_plans`+`dca_plan_items` for the month and `MailApp.sendEmail`s it to chanika.cptk@gmail.com. `mode='submit'` (default) = progress snapshot, no status change; `mode='complete'` also flags every plan `completed`. Backs the DCA page's **Submit & Email** + **Complete Month** buttons. Params `userId`, `month` (`YYYY-MM`), `mode` |
| `benchmarkHistory` | `_yahooChart` per symbol — params `symbols` (comma-sep, e.g. `^GSPC,^IXIC,NVDA`), `range` (6mo/1y/ytd/5d…), `interval` (1d/1h/1m). Returns `result.series = { SYMBOL: {t:[unixSec],c:[close]} }`; thin never-throwing Yahoo `/v8/chart` proxy. Backs the US Portfolio **Benchmark** tab |
| `scrapeBondInfo` | DataAgent.scrapeBondInfo(bondCode) — scrapes ThaiBMA, caches in bond_master |
| `refreshMFNav` | DataAgent.refreshMFNav() — daily NAV refresh for MF holdings with an auto source. **Tiered**: Tier 1 Finnomena by `fund_code` (`_fetchFinnomenaNav`) → Tier 2 SEC by `sec_proj_id` (`_secNavForHolding`) → Tier 3 manual (untouched). Stores `current_nav_thb`, `nav_date` (source valuation date), `nav_updated_at`; returns `{checked, updated, skipped}`; never throws/overwrites manual NAV. Holdings query: `or=(sec_proj_id.not.is.null,fund_code.not.is.null)` |
| `mfLookupClasses` | DataAgent.lookupMFClasses(projId) — returns `[{fund_class_name, last_val, nav_date}]` for the "Find classes" picker |
| `mfSearchFunds` | DataAgent.lookupMFFunds(q) — searches SEC `/v2/fund/general-info/profiles?fund_class_name=` by (partial) name; returns `[{proj_id, fund_class_name, proj_name_en, amc_name}]`; partial matching works; user taps result to auto-fill `sec_proj_id` + class |
| `mfGuessCode` | DataAgent.searchFinnomenaFunds(q) — Finnomena `GET …/funds/v2/public/funds/search?q=` by fund name or code fragment; no key; returns `[{short_code, name_en, name_th, active}]` (≤25); backs the MF modal's "Guess code from fund name" button → user taps to fill `fund_code`. Never throws |

## Daily Tech-News brief (NotificationAgent)

Standalone morning notification, **separate from the portfolio reviews**. `sendDailyNewsBrief()` runs per user:
1. **Gather holdings** — `_getUserHoldingsForBrief(userId)`: US tickers (growth/dividend/etf via `portfolios`→`holdings`) drive 🎯 matching; Thai mutual-fund names passed as secondary awareness.
2. **Generate** — `_callClaudeWebSearch()` calls Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) with the **server-side `web_search` tool** (`{type:'web_search_20250305', max_uses:6}`). One API call: the model runs its own searches for today's tech/market news and returns a JSON object `{holdings_stories[], market_stories[], sources[]}`. Stories about a held ticker go in `holdings_stories` (lead the brief); the rest in `market_stories`. Each summary is one line of Thai+English with concrete numbers + price reaction; holdings stories also get a one-line `impact` note. **Never fabricates** — every figure must come from a search result.
3. **Render + send** — `_renderNewsBrief()` builds the message and `_sendHtml()` sends it via Telegram with **`parse_mode: HTML`**. **Telegram is capped** (`_TG_MAX_TOTAL=6`, `_TG_MAX_HOLDINGS=4`: holdings lead, fill the rest with top market stories) to stay scannable, with a `+N more in the app → Analysis` footer. The model is prompted for the **full set** (~8-12 stories, ordered most-important-first); the cap only trims the chat — persistence (step 4) keeps everything, so the Analysis page shows them all. (not Markdown/MarkdownV2 — the brief is full of `$ % + - ( )` and Thai text that constantly break Markdown escaping; HTML only needs `& < >` escaped, done by `_escapeHtml`). Logged as `notification_type='news_brief'`.
4. **Persist** — `_persistNewsBrief(userId, data)` stores each story into `daily_news` (+ per-user impact into `daily_news_impact`) so the **Analysis page** can browse history. Idempotent per (user, news_date): deletes that day's rows first, then bulk-inserts (holdings rows first, so their ids map to impact rows). `_sentimentFromEmoji()` derives the card color bucket. Fully non-fatal — a DB error here never affects the Telegram send.

- Trigger: `onNewsBriefTrigger` daily @ 7AM (project TZ Asia/Bangkok). Manual: web action `sendNewsBrief` or `testNewsBrief()` in the GAS IDE.
- Requires `CLAUDE_API_KEY` (web_search must be enabled for the org) + `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — both already configured. No new Script Property.
- Fully non-fatal: per-user errors log & skip; a failed/empty brief sends nothing rather than a broken message.
- `_thaiDateLabel()` builds the Buddhist-era date deterministically (no locale dependency).
- **Robustness** (after a 2026-06-26 dropped-brief incident — one user truncated): `max_tokens` is **5000** (the full-set prompt was overflowing 3500 → truncated JSON → null), `_callClaudeWebSearch` logs when `stop_reason === 'max_tokens'`, and `sendDailyNewsBrief` **retries the call once** on null before giving up. The brief is generated **per user** (separate web_search call each), so one user failing never affects the other.

## Market data sources (DataAgent)

| Asset | Source | Stored as |
|---|---|---|
| Gold (spot) | Stooq.com CSV → GLD ETF÷0.093252 → goldprice.org → metals.live | `XAU` in `market_data` |
| S&P 500 | Yahoo Finance `^GSPC` | `SP500` in `market_data` |
| SET Index | Yahoo Finance `^SET.BK` | `SET` in `market_data` |
| USD/THB | Yahoo Finance `THB=X` | `USDTHB` in `exchange_rates` |
| Crypto | CoinGecko API | coin symbol in `market_data` |
| Thai bond info | ThaiBMA EN website scrape (cached in `bond_master`) | — |
| Mutual fund NAV (Tier 1) | **Finnomena public API** `GET https://www.finnomena.com/fn3/api/fund/v2/public/funds/{fund_code}/nav/q?range=1M` — **no API key**, keyed by plain fund code (e.g. `ES-FIXEDRMF`), returns `{ data: { fund_id, short_code, navs:[{date,value,amount}] } }` (`value`=NAV/unit, chronological). Freshest source, widest coverage (incl. funds **absent from SEC profiles** like ES-FIXEDRMF). Source is Morningstar (`fund_id` = Morningstar SecId). Confirmed reachable from GAS 2026-06-24. Tried first whenever a `fund_code` is set. **Code matching is case-insensitive and trims whitespace** (verified 2026-06-25 with `ES-GQGRMF`: lowercase + trailing-space both 200); an unknown code returns HTTP 404 with a `{status:false}` JSON body. `_fetchFinnomenaNav` never throws | `current_nav_thb` + `nav_date` + `nav_updated_at` on `mutual_fund_holdings` |
| Mutual fund NAV (Tier 2 fallback) | SEC Open Data v2 `GET /v2/fund/daily-info/nav?proj_id&start_nav_date&end_nav_date` (header `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`); response wrapped in `{ items: [...], next_cursor, page_size }`; `last_val` = NAV/unit; matched on exact `fund_class_name`; **NAV lag is fund-specific** (not just weekends) — SEC publishes days after valuation date; `_secApiItems` follows `next_cursor` pagination (≤10 pages) so all rows are fetched. Official fallback, used only when Finnomena returns nothing | same columns on `mutual_fund_holdings` |
| Mutual fund search | SEC Open Data v2 `GET /v2/fund/general-info/profiles?fund_class_name=` — partial name matching works (e.g. "KKP CorePath" → 12 results); fields: `proj_id`, `fund_class_name`, `proj_name_en`, `comp_name_en` (AMC) | frontend display only |
| Mutual fund code search | **Finnomena public** `GET https://www.finnomena.com/fn3/api/fund/v2/public/funds/search?q=` — no key; returns `{ data: [{ short_code, name_th, name_en, sec_is_active, … }] }`; matches **code fragments / short names** well (full English names give fuzzy hits). Backs the modal's "Guess code from fund name" helper to fill `fund_code` | frontend display only |

> Thai Mutual Fund NAV fetching (SEC Open Data API + scrapers) was removed 2026-06-19. See **"Mutual Funds — rebuild plan"** at the bottom for prior findings and the fresh-start design.

**Gold price chain** (`_fetchGoldSpotPrice()` in DataAgent.gs): each source logs its HTTP code + raw body to the GAS execution log for diagnosis. Yahoo Finance forex symbols (`XAUUSD=X`) are unreliable from GAS server IPs — equity/ETF prices (GLD) are used instead as fallback.

**Standalone tests** — run from GAS IDE:
- `testGoldPrice()`, `testBondScrape()` — existing
- `testSingleFundNAV()` — confirmed SEC v2 `/fund/daily-info/nav` call for `M0209_2554`; logs all classes + `last_val` per class. Response is `{ items: [...] }`.
- `testSearchMFFunds()` — confirmed SEC v2 `/fund/general-info/profiles` by name; logs raw body + mapped `[{proj_id, fund_class_name, proj_name_en, amc_name}]`. Partial name matching works.
- `testFinnomenaNav()` — confirmed Finnomena public NAV API reachable from GAS (no key); tests `ES-GQGRMF`, `ES-FIXEDRMF` + 1 control, logs latest NAV per fund. PASS = every code shows a NAV; FAIL = HTTP 403 / HTML challenge (IP-blocked). Edit the `CODES` array to check a specific held fund's reachability from GAS.

## Pages / navigation

6-tab bottom nav: **Home · US · Cash · Asset · Analysis · Settings**

`navigate(page)` → `loadPage(page)` dispatches to the loader function.

```
dashboard     Home — net worth, Me/Combined toggle, donut, asset cards
us            US Portfolio — combined metric cards, tab per portfolio, holdings table, + a trailing 📊 Benchmark tab (portfolio vs NASDAQ/S&P 500, normalized-to-100 line chart)
gold          Gold — metric cards, S/R bar, holdings table, add/edit modal
mf            Mutual Funds — hero (total + P/L + "checked / NAV as of" dates), sort bar, expandable fund cards with NAV date badge, SEC name search, auto-refresh via SEC API
cash          Cash — total summary card, grouped by type (Savings/FD/FCD)
insurance     Insurance — INFORMATIONAL ONLY (excluded from net worth). Summary (active count + annual premium commitment + ⏰ due-within-30-days) + per-policy cards (type badge, status dot, sum-assured/maturity/premium/next-due grid, last-paid line, edit/delete) + add/edit modal. All THB.
private       Private Investment — summary (total principal, expected annual income, company/govbond split) + per-investment cards (company loans & govt bonds), add/edit/delete modal with type toggle
bonds         Thai Bonds — KPI cards, 2 donut charts, master-detail list
loans         Loan — receivables (money lent out). Summary (total remaining / principal lent / expected interest, active loans only) + per-loan cards (remaining, progress bar, next payment, status badge). Tap a card → detail view with the installment schedule checklist: per-row **Record Payment** (partial or full — amount added to a running tally), inline **editable due date**, and reset (↺). EXCLUDED from net worth. add/edit modal generates the schedule from frequency × count.
analysis      Analysis — daily Tech-News brief history (date selector + 🎯 holdings news + 📊 market news, sentiment-colored cards) on top, then a "Tools" hub (DCA/Monthly/Weekly/All Portfolio). Reads daily_news + daily_news_impact directly via Supabase.
dca           DCA Plan — multi-portfolio manual planner. Month selector (+ "+" to add next month) + portfolio tabs; per tab: budget input + 🔄 Refresh (gap-from-target suggestions), a TICKER/Reasoning/Suggested/Planned/Actual/✓ table, status pill (DRAFT→IN PROGRESS→COMPLETED) + progress bar. 📧 Submit & Email (always) + ✅ Complete Month (all ticked) email a summary via GAS `dcaEmailSummary`.
monthly       Monthly Review — trigger generateDCA
weekly        Weekly Review — trigger analyzeAll
allportfolio  All Portfolio — read-only AI signals across all holdings
settings      Theme, profile, Telegram, GAS URL
partner       Partner view (no nav entry; navigate('partner') directly)
```

Nav highlight logic:
- `nav-analysis` → analysis, monthly, weekly, allportfolio, dca
- `nav-more` → gold, **mf**, insurance, private, **bonds**, **loans**
- `nav-cash` → cash
- others → `nav-${page}`

## Key functions

### Home dashboard
- `loadDashboard()` — parallel fetch both users, renders hero + user cards + donut; asset summary is rendered by `_refreshDonut` (not by `loadDashboard` itself)
- `calcUserData(userId)` → `{ totalUSD, costBasisUSD, gainLossUSD, portfolios[], cashUSD, cashBreakdown, goldUSD, mfUSD, privateUSD, insuranceUSD, bondsUSD, cryptoUSD, otherUSD }`
- `switchDonutMode('me'|'combined')` — re-renders donut from `_dbCache` without re-fetching
- `_refreshDonut()` → `_renderAssetSummary(segments, totalUSD)` — 2-column card grid (`#db-port-summary`) below donut; one card per donut segment, percentages match exactly. **Note**: the old `#db-metrics` 2×2 grid (US Portfolio / Cash / Gold / Other) was removed 2026-06-20 — it was duplicate stale code.

### US Portfolio
- `loadUSPortfolio()` — builds tabs + calls `_computeUSCombinedMetrics` and `loadPortfolioTab` in parallel
- `_computeUSCombinedMetrics(portfolios)` — fetches all holdings + prev-day prices, returns combined value/PL/dayChange
- `loadPortfolioTab(portfolioId, tabBtn)` — fetches holdings + prices + prev prices + analyses; renders stats bar + table
- Stats bar includes: Value · Cost · P/L · 1D Change · N positions
- **Ticker Detail modal** — tapping a `$ticker` in any holdings table calls `openTickerDetail(ticker)` (no navigation). Fetches GAS `getHistory`, then `_tdRender` builds a **header** (logo · ticker · name · price + day change) and a **horizontal scrollable pill tab bar** (`.td-tabbar` / `.td-tab`, TradingView-style, active = `--accent`): **Overview · Technicals · News · Earnings · Simulator**. Bottom-sheet modal (`#td-modal`), same pattern as gold/bond modals. Only the active tab's content is rendered into `#td-tab-content` — `_tdShowTab(tab)` swaps it. Shared state in `_tdCtx = {ticker, hist, g, price}`; each tab's async data is **lazy-loaded on first view**.
  - **Overview tab** (`_tdOverviewHtml` / `_tdFetchOverview`) — TradingView-style key-stats list (`.td-ov-row` label-left/value-right): Volume, Average volume (30D), Market cap, Dividend yield (indicated — only shown when > 0), P/E (TTM), Basic EPS (TTM), Net income (FY), Revenue (FY), Shares float, Beta (1Y), 52-week high/low. Data from **GAS `getOverview`** (Yahoo v10 quoteSummary — see GAS actions); cached per-ticker in `_tdOverview` (`{_error:true}` on failure → Thai "unavailable" message), `_tdOverviewToken` drops out-of-order fetches. Big numbers via `_tdFmtBig(v, cur)` (T/B/M/K, `$` when `cur`).
  - **Technicals tab** (`_tdTechnicalsHtml`, unchanged logic, just relocated): `_techRSI` (Wilder 14), `_techSMA` (20/50), `_techMACD` (12/26/9), combined by `_techGauge(closes)` into a score ∈ [−1,+1] → bucket `Strong Sell…Strong Buy`. `_tdGaugeSVG(score)` draws the 5-segment semicircle + needle. Validated on live NVDA (−0.46 → "Sell").
  - **News tab** (`_tdLoadNews`, unchanged): reads `daily_news` for the user `ilike` ticker, newest first, dedupes by headline similarity (`_tdNewsSimilar`, Jaccard ≥ 0.5), caps 5. Empty state in Thai. No live API — uses persisted brief only.
  - **Earnings tab** (`_tdEarningsHtml` / `_tdFetchEarnings`, cached in `_tdEarnings`) — a **next-earnings-date** card (from `calendarEvents`, relative "in Nd"/"Nd ago" via `_tdEarnDateLabel`) + the **last 4 quarters newest-first** as cards (`_tdEarnQuarterCard`): EPS estimate, EPS actual, Revenue, and a **Beat/Miss badge** with EPS surprise % (green beat / red miss, computed client-side from actual vs estimate). Data from **GAS `getEarnings`** → `_yahooEarnings` (Yahoo quoteSummary `earnings,earningsHistory,calendarEvents`) with a **Claude web-search fallback** (`_claudeEarnings`) only when Yahoo returns nothing. Empty state for ETFs/funds (no earnings). Yahoo has no historical revenue *estimate*, so the revenue cell shows the actual (estimate sub-line only appears via the Claude path); `{_error:true}` → Thai "unavailable" message. A **"ที่มา · Source:" footer** (`.td-earn-src`) shows provenance — `Yahoo Finance` or `Web search (Claude)` per `_tdEarnings.source`; the Overview tab carries the same footer (always Yahoo Finance).
  - **Simulator tab** (`_tdSimulatorHtml`, unchanged DCA logic, relocated): simulate adding to the position before buying. **Only renders when the user actually holds the ticker** — looks it up in `_portTableData` (current tab's rows, case-insensitive) for live shares + avg cost; otherwise a "not held" message. Amount input (USD, `inputmode=decimal`) + preset chips ($50/$100/$200/$500 via `_tdDcaSet`) recalc **live on every keystroke** (`_tdDcaCalc`, no submit). Shows Current → After for Shares / Avg Cost / Value / P/L % (`_tdDcaRows`), P/L color-coded; avg-cost **delta badge** under the new avg. Pure client-side math. State in `_tdDca`.
  - Globals/CSS: `_tdCtx` / `_tdTab` / `_tdOverview` / `_tdOverviewToken` / `_tdEarnings` / `_tdEarningsToken` / `_tdDca`; `.td-*` classes (incl. `.td-tabbar`/`.td-tab`/`.td-tabpane`/`.td-ov-*`/`.td-earn-*`/`.td-pane-msg`/`.td-dca-*`); functions prefixed `_tech*` / `_td*` / `openTickerDetail` / `closeTickerDetail` (the latter clears all per-ticker state).

### Gold
- `loadGold(_liveRefreshed?)` — fetches holdings + XAU price (DB cache) + prev-day price + sr_levels; renders metric cards + S/R bar + table. After render, fires `callGAS('getGoldPrice')` in background; if live price differs >0.1% from cached, updates `state.cache['XAU']` and re-renders once with `_liveRefreshed=true` to prevent loop.
- Gold S/R comes from `sr_levels` table (`ticker='XAU'`) — populated when GAS `updateSRLevels` runs
- `openAddGold()` / `openEditGold(id)` / `saveGold()` / `deleteGold(id)`
- `calcGoldTotal()` — auto-computes total cost (oz × avg cost) in modal

### Mutual Funds
- `loadMutualFunds()` → `_loadMutualFundsInner(el)` — fetches `mutual_fund_holdings` (selects `nav_date` too), computes per-holding value/cost/PL, renders hero + sort bar + expandable fund cards. All THB. Wrapped in try/catch (errors only toast, never crash).
- Per holding: `costValue = units × avg_cost_thb`; value uses `current_nav_thb` when set, **else falls back to cost basis** (so a fund with no NAV still counts toward net worth but shows P/L `—`). `isAuto = !!sec_proj_id && nav_updated_at < 48h`.
- `_renderMFHero(latestTs)` — hero shows `"checked DD Mon · latest NAV DD Mon"` (newest `nav_date` across all linked funds via `.sort().pop()`; shows valuation lag clearly).
- `_renderMFList()` / `setMFSort(key)` / `toggleMFExpand(id)` / `_mfCatStyle(cat)`
- Expanded card detail shows: Cost value · Units · Cost/Unit · Current NAV · **NAV date (SEC)** · **Last checked** · Purchase date · Notes.
- Badge: 🟢 **Auto NAV · DD Mon** (SEC valuation date inline) when `isAuto`, else 🟡 **Manual NAV**.
- **Modal**: Buy/Sell type toggle, free-text fund name (`autocapitalize="words"`) + `<datalist>` local autocomplete + **🔍 Search SEC database** button, category pills (Onshore/Offshore/RMF/ESG/SSF/Other), 3 input methods (Total Baht / Total Units / Manual), Cost/Unit, Purchase date, optional Current NAV, optional `sec_proj_id` + **Find classes** button + class name field, collapsible notes. All money fields use `inputmode="decimal"` (shows decimal-point key on mobile). `saveMF()` is a pure DB insert/update; **never awaits a GAS/external call**. After the save commits, closes, and reloads the list, if the holding has a `fund_code` or `sec_proj_id` it kicks a **fire-and-forget** `callGAS('refreshMFNav')` (`.then`/`.catch`, never awaited) so a new auto-source fund flips 🟡 Manual → 🟢 Auto within a few seconds instead of waiting for the 8PM trigger or a manual ↻. All errors swallowed.
- **SEC fund search**: `searchMFFunds()` → GAS `mfSearchFunds?q=` → tappable results list → `_pickMFFund(i)` auto-fills `sec_proj_id` + `sec_fund_class_name`. Explicit button; never blocks save.
- **Guess fund code** (under the Fund code field): `guessFundCode()` → GAS `mfGuessCode?q=` (Finnomena search) → tappable share-class list → `_pickFundCode(i)` fills `mf-fund-code`. Query = fund-name box, falling back to a partial code typed in the field. State in `_mfCodeResults`, cleared by `_mfModalReset`; reuses the `.mf-search-row*` styles. Pure convenience — never blocks save; the post-save fire-and-forget `refreshMFNav` then flips 🟡→🟢.
- **Find classes**: `lookupMFClasses()` → GAS `mfLookupClasses?projId=` → class dropdown (`_onMFClassSelect`). Use after pasting a proj_id manually.
- `openMFNavModal(id, name)` / `saveMFNav()` — "Update NAV" button stores `current_nav_thb` + `nav_updated_at` only (no `nav_date` — that's SEC-sourced).
- Top-bar ↻ → `refreshMFNav()` → GAS `refreshMFNav` → reloads page.
- Globals: `_mfListData`, `_mfEditId`, `_mfSortKey`, `_mfExpandedId`, `_mfCategory`, `_mfInputMethod`, `_mfType`, `_mfNavId`, `_mfSearchResults`, `_mfCodeResults`.

### Cash
- `loadCash()` — shows total summary card (grouped by sub_type) above account sections
- `balance` column is always THB principal for all account types
- FCD: `balance = fcd_amount × fcd_purchase_rate`

### Private Investment
- `loadPrivate()` — fetches `private_holdings`, renders a summary card (Total Principal + position count, Expected Annual Income = Σ principal×rate for **active** only, **Next Payout** amount+date, Private Company vs Government Bond split) + one card per investment. All THB.
- Cards show: name, plan name, type chip, status pill (active=green / matured=gray / withdrawn=amber), principal, interest/coupon % + payout frequency, **next payout** (amount + date, active only), maturity date + countdown (`_privCountdown`, active only). Edit ✎ / delete 🗑 icons.
- `_privNextPayout(it)` → `{date, amt}` for the next periodic payout — **reuses the Thai-bond helpers** `_nextCouponDate` (start_date as anchor) + `_couponPerPayment` (principal_thb base). Null `payout_freq` = lump sum at maturity (no schedule).
- Modal: type toggle (**Private Company** / **Government Bond**) re-labels fields & hides term/withdrawn for govbond. `calcPrivMaturity()` auto-fills maturity = start + term (months/years), still editable. `savePriv()` is a pure DB insert/update (no external calls).
- Net-worth contribution = `principal_thb` (THB), wired into `calcUserData` + `loadMore` as `privateUSD`/`privTHB`.
- Globals: `_privEditId`, `_privType`, `_privStatus`. Reuses `_daysTo` / `_fmtShortDate` / `_numInputFmt` / `_parseNum` from the bonds section.

### Insurance (informational — excluded from net worth)
- `loadInsurance()` — fetches `insurance_policies`, renders a summary card + per-policy cards + add/edit modal. **Active = `status === 'in_force'`.** Summary: active count, annual premium commitment (`_insAnnualPremium` = `premium_amount_thb × _INS_FREQ[mode]`, summed over in-force only), and a ⏰ "due within 30 days" highlight (in-force policies whose `next_due_date` is 0–30 days out via `_daysTo`). Every render shows an "ℹ️ Informational only — not in net worth" note.
- Card: product name (`policy_name`) + `policy_type` badge + insurer/`policy_number`, status dot (`_INS_STATUS`: in_force=green / lapsed=red / matured=gray), 2-col grid (Sum Assured | Maturity, Premium + mode | Next Due), "Last paid: …" line, edit ✎ / delete 🗑.
- Modal (`#ins-modal`): policy-type pills (`setInsType`), insurer/number, product name (required → `policy_name`), insured + status, policy/maturity dates, sum assured, premium mode + amount (`_insRenderAnnual` live-previews the annualized total), payment method, next due, optional latest-payment (date/amount/method), notes. `saveIns()` is a pure DB insert/update; `openAddIns`/`openEditIns`/`closeInsModal`/`deleteIns`. Money fields use `_numInputFmt`/`_parseNum`.
- **EXCLUDED from net worth** — `calcUserData` no longer queries `insurance_policies`; the home donut "Insurance" segment was removed; `loadMore` shows the Asset-hub row as total annual premium (in-force) with no % and an "Informational · not in net worth" sublabel. Legacy `annual_premium_thb` / `surrender_value_thb` columns are untouched but unread.
- Globals/helpers: `_insEditId`, `_insType`, `_INS_FREQ` (payments/yr by mode), `_INS_STATUS`, `_insAnnualPremium`, `_esc` (shared HTML-escape). Reuses `_fmtShortDate` / `_daysTo` / `_numInputFmt` / `_parseNum` / `fmtTHB`.

### Asset hub (More page)
- `loadMore()` — fetches live THB values for all 5 asset types in parallel (gold, insurance, private, **MF**, bonds), renders each row as: icon + name | ฿value + % of subtotal | ›
- % is share of the five-asset subtotal (gold + insurance + private + MF + bonds), not total portfolio
- MF value = `units × current_nav_thb` (falls back to cost basis when NAV not set)
- **Loans row** is separate: shows total **outstanding** balance (principal − Σ paid) with a "Receivable · not in net worth" sublabel and **no %** — its value is never folded into the subtotal/`total` above.

### Loans (receivables)
- `loadLoans()` — fetches `loans` with embedded `loan_payments(*)`, renders the summary card (Total Remaining / Principal Lent / Expected Interest — **active = non-completed loans only**) + one `_renderLoanCard()` per loan. Resets to list view; shows the + button. All THB.
- **Status is fully derived from `paid_amount` vs `expected_amount` + today** (never trust the stored column for display). Per-installment `_loanPmtStatus(p)`: `paid` (paid ≥ expected) / `partial` (0 < paid < expected) / `overdue` (nothing paid & past due) / `pending`. Helpers: `_loanPaid`/`_loanExpected`/`_loanIsFullyPaid`/`_loanIsOverdue` (overdue = not-fully-paid & past due — flagged even on a `partial` row). `_loanStatus(loan, payments)`: `completed` when **whole principal collected** (Σ paid ≥ principal) / `overdue` (any overdue installment) / `active`. Loan colors `_LOAN_STATUS` (active=accent/blue, completed=muted/gray, overdue=danger/red); per-row colors `_LOAN_PMT_COLOR` (partial=**warning/orange**).
- **Partial payments** (option (b) — per-row running tally, no auto-roll-forward): `paid_amount` is the cumulative ฿ paid on the installment. `_loanPaidSum` = Σ paid across rows; loan **Remaining** = principal − Σ paid (reflects actual ฿ received, not just full-paid count); **Collected** = Σ paid; **Progress** = `_loanFullyPaidCount` (rows fully paid) / N, and the list progress bar tracks ฿ collected / principal.
- `_loanSchedule(loan)` — pure function: generates the installment rows (due date = `loan_date` + interval×i, expected = `installment_amount`). Interval months from `_loanInterval` (monthly=1, quarterly=3, custom=`custom_interval_months`). Used by both the modal live preview (`calcLoanSchedulePreview`) and persistence.
- `_syncLoanSchedule(loanId, loan)` — (re)builds the schedule on save **without losing paid history**: keeps every `paid` row, deletes all `pending` rows, re-inserts pending rows for installment numbers not already paid. Runs on both create and edit.
- Card: borrower + principal, remaining, progress bar, `X of N paid · ฿collected`, next pending payment (remaining due on the earliest not-fully-paid row), status badge. Tap card → `selectLoan(id)` master-detail view (`_renderLoanDetail`) with the full schedule checklist; `closeLoanDetail()` returns to the list.
- **Record Payment** (partial-aware, **increment** semantics): per-row button → `openLoanPay(id, expected, paidSoFar)` → `loanpay-modal` (shows "already paid", input prefilled with the **remaining due**, date defaults today) → `confirmLoanPay()` **adds** the entered amount to `paid_amount`, sets `paid_date` + `paid_at`, and flips `status` to `paid` once the tally reaches expected. **Reset ↺** (`unmarkLoanPay`) zeroes `paid_amount`/`paid_date`/`paid_at` → pending.
- **Editable due dates**: each row renders an inline `<input type="date">` (+ ✏️ hint) → `saveLoanDueDate(paymentId, newDate)` PATCHes that one row's `due_date` only — **never shifts the rest** (real-world renegotiation hits one payment at a time); overdue recomputes on re-render.
- Modal: `openAddLoan` / `openEditLoan` / `saveLoan` / `deleteLoan` (cascade-deletes payments). Frequency toggle `setLoanFreq` (monthly/quarterly/custom; custom reveals the interval field). `saveLoan` upserts the loan then calls `_syncLoanSchedule`.
- **Loans are excluded from net worth** — `loadLoans`/`loadMore` are the only readers; nothing wires into `calcUserData`/donut.
- Globals: `_loanEditId`, `_loanFreq`, `_selectedLoanId`, `_loanPayCtx` (`{paymentId, expected, already}`). Reuses `_numInputFmt` / `_parseNum` / `_fmtShortDate` / `_daysTo` / `fmtTHB` and the `.bond-back-btn` style.

### Analysis (News brief history)
- `loadAnalysis()` — entry for the Analysis tab. Queries distinct `news_date` for `state.userId`, populates the date dropdown, defaults `_anDate` to **the most recent day that has news** (today if present, else latest; today is always kept selectable so an empty day shows "No news yet"), then `_anRenderDate()`.
- `_anRenderDate()` — fetches `daily_news` for the user+date with embedded `daily_news_impact(impact)` (PostgREST FK embed), ordered by `sort_order`; sets the ‹ older / newer › button disabled states; calls `_anPaint()`.
- `_anPaint()` — splits rows into 🎯 holdings (`is_holding_related`) + 📊 market sections, renders `_anCard()` for each. Honours the active `_anTickerFilter`.
- `_anCard(r)` — sentiment-colored card (`_anSentClass`: positive=green / negative=red / neutral=blue left border): emoji + clickable `$ticker` badge + headline + impact box (holdings only) + `ที่มา:` sources.
- Date nav: `anSelectDate(d)` (dropdown), `anStepDate(±1)` (‹/›). Ticker filter (nice-to-have): `anFilterTicker(t)` / `anClearFilter()` filter the loaded date's rows to one ticker.
- Helpers: `_anEsc` (HTML escape), `_bkkToday`, `_anDateLabel` (Today / Yesterday / date). Reads Supabase directly (anon read); no GAS call. The page is data-only — all writes come from `sendDailyNewsBrief()`.

### DCA Plan (multi-portfolio planner)
- `loadDCA()` — fetches `portfolios` (→ tabs, cached in `_dcaPorts` with `_bmEmoji`) + distinct `dca_plans.month_year` (→ month selector, always incl. current month); defaults `_dcaMonth`=current, `_dcaPortId`=first; renders the month bar + `#dca-tabs` + `#dca-tab-content` + `#dca-complete-wrap`, then `_dcaRenderActive()`.
- `_dcaRenderActive()` — for (`_dcaPortId`, `_dcaMonth`): loads the plan + its items, derives status (`_dcaDeriveStatus`, mirrored to DB), computes planned/actual/done sums, renders the header (month · status pill · budget input · Refresh), summary line, the 6-col table (each row: logo+ticker, reasoning, suggested, editable Planned/Actual inputs, ✓ checkbox), and the progress bar; then `_dcaUpdateCompleteBtn()`. When no plan exists, budget is prefilled from `_dcaPriorBudget` (latest prior month, else `portfolios.dca_budget_usd`).
- Tabs/month: `_dcaRenderTabs`, `_dcaSelectPort(id)`, `_dcaSelectMonth(m)`. `_dcaMonthLabel`/`_dcaThisMonth`/`_dcaFmtInput` helpers.
- `_dcaEnsurePlan()` — lazily inserts a `dca_plans` row (status draft, current budget) for the active tab; called by budget/refresh/edit handlers so nothing is written until the user acts.
- `_dcaRefresh()` — ensures the plan, saves budget, runs `_dcaGenerate(portId, budget)` (returns **every holding**: `currentPct=value/totalValue`, `gap=target-current`; only `gap>0` tickers split the budget ∝ gap, overweight → suggested 0 + "At/above" reasoning, no-target → suggested 0 + "No target % set"; sorted suggested-desc; Suggested non-editable), then `_dcaSyncItems(planId, generated)` **rebuilds Suggested/reasoning while preserving Planned/Actual/Done per ticker** (updates matches, deletes empty rows for tickers no longer held, inserts new).
- Cell edits: `_dcaEditItem(id, field, el)` (Planned/Actual, `_parseNum`), `_dcaToggleDone(id, el)` — each patches `dca_plan_items` then re-renders.
- `_dcaAddNextMonth()` — the **"+"** button: computes the month after the newest (`_dcaMonthAdd`), inserts a blank `dca_plans` row for the active portfolio (budget from `_dcaPriorBudget`, no items), sets `_dcaMonth` to it, reloads. The month then shows in the selector (which is built from distinct plan months).
- `_dcaUpdateCompleteBtn()` — queries all of the month's plans with embedded `dca_plan_items(is_done)`; renders **📧 Submit & Email Summary** (always, when ≥1 item) + **✅ Complete Month** (only when all ticked). `_dcaSubmitEmail()` → `callGAS('dcaEmailSummary', {userId, month, mode:'submit'})` (snapshot, no status change); `_dcaCompleteMonth()` → same with `mode:'complete'` (marks plans completed) then reloads. Both toast `Email sent to chanika.cptk@gmail.com ✓`.
- Globals: `_dcaMonth`, `_dcaPortId`, `_dcaPorts`, `_dcaMonths`, `_DCA_STATUS`. Reuses `_bmEmoji`/`_assetLogoImg`/`_numInputFmt`/`_parseNum`/`fmtUSD`/`_esc`. CSS `.dca-*` (monthbar/tabs/head/io/progress/complete). **Replaced the old `loadDCA`/`approveDCA` single-plan approval flow.**

### US Portfolio — Benchmark tab
- Lives on the **US Portfolio** page as the last `.tab-btn` in `#portfolio-tabs` (appended in `loadUSPortfolio` after the portfolio tabs). `showBenchmarkTab(btn)` sets it active, injects `_bmMarkup()` into `#portfolio-content`, then calls `initBenchmark()`. (`loadPortfolioTab` clears all tab-btn active states, so switching back to a portfolio de-activates it.)
- `_bmMarkup()` — returns the benchmark section HTML (title `Benchmark Comparison`, Thai subtitle, pill container, Timescale/Timeframe segments pre-marked from `_bmScale`/`_bmTf`, chart card). Re-injected fresh on every tab click.
- `initBenchmark()` — fetches this user's `portfolios` **once** (cached in `_bmPorts` as `{id,name,emoji}` via `_bmEmoji`), drops stale ids from `_bmSel` but otherwise keeps the selection across tab switches, renders pills, `renderBenchmark()`.
- `renderBenchmark()` — the pipeline: aggregate `shares` per ticker across the selected portfolios (`_bmSelectedIds`) → `symbols = ['^GSPC','^IXIC',...tickers]` → `callGAS('benchmarkHistory', {symbols, range:_bmRange(), interval:_bmScale})` → build master date axis from `^GSPC` → `_bmAlignSeries` (align each symbol to master keys, forward/back-fill) → portfolio series `Σ shares×close` per date (`_bmFfill`) → `_bmNorm` (÷base×100) → `_bmRenderChart`. A `_bmReqSeq` counter drops out-of-order async results.
- Selectors: `bmTogglePort(id)` (`'total'` = all; picking specifics starts a `Set`, never leaves nothing selected), `bmSetScale`/`bmSetTf` (update `_bmScale`/`_bmTf`, re-render). `_bmRange()` clamps `1m` interval → `5d` (Yahoo minute-data limit).
- Keying/labels: `_bmKey(t)` buckets by UTC date for daily (aligns index vs stock timestamps) / raw ts for intraday; `_bmLabel(t)` for x-axis.
- `_bmRenderChart(d)` — destroys/rebuilds the `bm-chart` Chart.js line (3 dashed datasets: NASDAQ `_BM_NASDAQ` #eab308, S&P `_BM_SP` #14b8a6, portfolio `_BM_PORT` #22d3ee), index-mode tooltip `value (±%)`, custom `#bm-legend`.
- Globals: `_bmScale`, `_bmTf`, `_bmPorts`, `_bmSel` (`'total'` | `Set<id>`), `_bmReqSeq`. CSS: `.bm-title`/`.bm-sub`/`.bm-lbl`/`.bm-pill`/`.bm-seg-btn`/`.bm-chart-*`/`.bm-legend`. Only reader of `benchmarkHistory`.

### Thai Bonds
- `loadBonds()` — fetches holdings, renders KPI cards → donut dashboard → 90d alert → bond list
- KPI cards: Total Invested (full-width), Next Coupon (with bond code), Avg. Coupon %
- **Portfolio dashboard**: 2 side-by-side donuts — Allocation by bond, Maturity distribution (< 90d / 90d–1yr / 1–3yr / >3yr); uses existing Chart.js `centerText` plugin
- **Master-detail layout**: sort bar (Code A→Z / Maturity ↑ / Amount ↓ / Coupon ↓) + search, tap bond → detail panel, "‹ All Bonds" back button
- `_renderBondSummary(bonds)` / `_renderBondDashboard(bonds)` / `_renderBondMaturingAlert(bonds)` / `_renderBondList(bonds, query)`
- `setBondSort(key)` — updates `_bondSortKey`, re-sorts live list
- `selectBond(id)` / `closeBondDetail()` — master-detail navigation
- `lookupBond()` — calls GAS `scrapeBondInfo`, pre-fills modal fields
- Modal: 3 input methods (Total Baht → auto-units, Total Units → auto-baht, Manual); all numeric inputs use `_numInputFmt(el)` for thousand separators; reads use `_parseNum(str)` to strip commas
- `openAddBond()` / `openEditBond(id)` / `saveBond()` / `deleteBond(id)`
- Bond helpers: `_ratingColor(rating)`, `_nextCouponDate(issued, maturity, type)`, `_couponPerPayment(face, rate, type)`, `_fmtShortDate(dateStr)`, `_daysTo(dateStr)`
- `bond_name NOT NULL` — `saveBond()` falls back to `bondCode` then `'(unnamed)'` so the constraint is never violated

## Thai bank config

`THAI_BANKS` embedded inline in `index.html` (19 banks). Helper: `_bankLogoImg(code, size)` → `<img>` with circular crop + brand-color border. Logos in `assets/banks/{CODE}.png`.

## Asset logos (US stocks / ETFs / crypto / gold)

Logo icons next to every `$ticker` in the holdings tables, the **Ticker Detail modal** header, and a generic fund icon on **Mutual Fund** cards. Same dual pattern as the banks: `src/config/assetLogos.js` is the canonical ES-module reference (`STOCK_LOGOS` / `ISSUER_LOGOS` / `ETF_LOGOS` / `MISC_LOGOS` → flattened `ASSET_LOGOS`), mirrored **inline** in `index.html` as `const ASSET_LOGOS` (the inline copy is what runs; the module is not imported). Keep the two in sync.

- **Paths are relative** (`assets/logos/...`, no leading slash) so they resolve under the GitHub Pages project subpath. (The mirror file uses leading-slash paths to match `banks.js` — cosmetic only.)
- **Sources** (downloaded once, committed): US stock logos from `davidepalazzo/ticker-logos` (`ticker_icons/<TICKER>.png`, ALL-CAPS); crypto + gold from `nvstly/icons` (`crypto_icons/`, `forex_icons/XAU.png`). Files stored UPPERCASE to match the ticker key (GitHub Pages is case-sensitive).
  - `assets/logos/us-stocks/<TICKER>.png` — individual brand logos (Growth + blue-chip/dividend stocks, plus O/MAIN REIT/BDC).
  - `assets/logos/issuers/<issuer>.png` — fund-**issuer** brands. `ticker-logos` has no per-ETF art (its "VTI.png" is just the Vanguard wordmark, "SCHD.png" the Schwab logo, "JEPI.png" the Chase octagon), so ETFs map to one consistent issuer logo: `vanguard` (VTI/VOO/VT/VXUS/BND/VHT/VNQ/VPU), `schwab` (SCHD/SCHG), `jpmorgan` (JEPI/JEPQ + the JPM stock), `invesco` (QQQ/**SPHD** — SPHD is an Invesco fund, not SPDR), `blackrock` (SGOV, iShares brand). Issuer files sourced from each issuer's own stock ticker (SCHW/JPM/IVZ/BLK); vanguard from the repo's VTI.png.
  - `assets/logos/misc/` — `BTC.png`, `ETH.png`, `XAU.png` (gold; **GLD** = SPDR Gold Shares reuses it), `fund.svg` (generic mutual-fund glyph, hand-made).
- **Helpers** (`index.html`): `_assetLogoImg(ticker, size)` returns a logo in a circular badge `<span>`, else `_tkBadge()` (deterministic colored **initials badge** — the only fallback for an unmapped ticker; never breaks the UI). `_fundLogoImg(size)` for the generic fund icon. `_tkBadgeEl()` is the DOM-node version used by `<img onerror>` to swap a broken logo for a badge.
- **Per-logo badge background** (`_logoStyle` + `LOGO_LIGHT` / `LOGO_FILL` sets, picked from measured logo brightness so contrast is correct in **both** light and dark theme, identical in each):
  - `.tk-light` = white badge — dark/colored logos (most).
  - `.tk-dark` = dark badge — white-on-transparent logos (`LOGO_LIGHT`: AAPL, AMZN, MAIN, RKLB, ABBV, MS, SGOV; + the white fund glyph).
  - `.tk-fill` = full-bleed tile fills the circle (`LOGO_FILL`: GLD, XAU).
- **Sizing gotcha**: the `<img>` is sized `width/height:84%` of the badge and flex-centered. Do **NOT** use CSS `padding:%` on `.tk-logo` — % padding resolves against the parent cell's width (not the badge), which collapsed the image to a dot (fixed 2026-06-27).
- Single render path: all US tabs (Growth/Dividend/ETF) go through `_renderPortTbody()` — there is no per-tab logo code. To add coverage for a new holding, just add the ticker to `ASSET_LOGOS` (and `LOGO_LIGHT` if it's a white logo). Current map covers all 30 live holdings.

## Thai AMC logos (mutual fund cards)

Mutual funds have no per-fund artwork, so each MF card is badged by its issuing **AMC** (asset-management company), derived from the fund-code/name prefix — added 2026-06-30, replacing the old generic black fund glyph.

- **Resolution**: `_mfAmc(h)` (in `index.html`) reads `h.fund_code || h.sec_fund_class_name || h.fund_name`, uppercases, and matches a prefix → AMC key. Order matters (KKP before K-, KT- before K-): `KKP`→kkp, `KT-`/`KTAM`→ktam, `ES-`→eastspring, `1AM`/`ONE-`→one, `PRINCIPAL`→principal, `UOB`→uob, `TISCO`/`TG`/`TE`→tisco, `K-`/`KPLAN`→kasikorn. (`TG`/`TE` are TISCO — e.g. TGSMARTRMF, TEGRMF; confirmed via Finnomena.)
- **Map**: `AMC_LOGOS` (inline `const` in `index.html`, mirrored in `src/config/assetLogos.js` — keep in sync) → `assets/logos/amc/*.png`.
- **Sources**: 5 bank-affiliated AMCs **reuse the bank brand logos**, copied from `assets/banks/` (KKP→`kkp.png`, KBANK→`kasikorn.png`, TISCO→`tisco.png`, UOB→`uob.png`, KTB→`ktam.png`). **Eastspring** = its double-chevron mark cropped/trimmed from the Wikimedia Commons `Eastspring Investments.png` wordmark (the wide wordmark itself is illegible in a circle). **Principal** = the white-P blue-gradient apple-touch-icon from principal.com.
- **Badge style** (same `.tk-logo` system as asset logos): `tk-light` (white badge) for all except `AMC_LOGO_DARK` = `{kkp}` (pale logo → dark badge) and `AMC_LOGO_FILL` = `{principal}` (full-bleed colored tile, `object-fit:cover`). Verified in both themes.
- **Fallback**: an AMC with no logo renders a **colored initials badge** (`_tkBadge` — the same deterministic badge unmapped stock tickers use), never a broken/blank slot or the old generic glyph. Badge text comes from `_fundBadgeLabel(h, amc)` = `AMC_LABEL[amc]` (known AMC, so every fund of that AMC shares one badge) → AMC key → `fund_code`/`fund_name`. **ONE Asset Management** (`1AM-`/`ONE-`) resolves to `amc='one'`, has no `AMC_LOGOS` entry (only a low-res wordmark exists), and `AMC_LABEL.one='ONE'` → both ONE funds show a purple **"ON"** badge. To upgrade to a real logo later: drop a clean square logo at `assets/logos/amc/one.png`, add the `one:` line to both `AMC_LOGOS` copies, and remove the `AMC_LABEL.one` entry.
- Coverage: 21 of 23 live holdings logo'd; the 2 ONE funds show the "ON" initials badge. `assets/logos/misc/fund.svg` is now unused.

## App icon

Source: `assets/icons/M+ V7.svg` (editable master, committed). Exported PNGs in `assets/icons/`: `favicon-16.png`, `favicon-32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` (180), `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` (192/512 are `purpose: any maskable`). 1024 raster master at `assets/icon-source.png`. Wired in `index.html` head (`<link rel="icon">` 16/32, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` 180, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`) + `manifest.json` `icons` array.

**Regen pipeline** (no rsvg/imagemagick/inkscape on this machine — only `sips` + Python `PIL`):
1. `qlmanage -t -s 1024 -o . "M+ V7.svg"` renders a **1024px master**. Gotcha: qlmanage rasterizes onto an **opaque white** background (the PNG has an alpha channel but every pixel is opaque), so a plain alpha-flatten is a no-op.
2. **Flood-fill** the connected white background from all four corners to `#f6e9cf` via `PIL.ImageDraw.floodfill(im, xy, (246,233,207), thresh=60)`. This recolors only the outer background — the off-white "M+" lettering enclosed inside the brown wallet is untouched (it's not corner-connected).
3. `Image.resize(..., LANCZOS)` to each size.

Background `#f6e9cf` matches the app `theme_color`/`background_color` (manifest) + `<meta name="theme-color">`. Bump SW cache only when `index.html` itself changes (icons aren't SW-cached; browsers cache favicons hard — hard-refresh / re-add iOS home-screen shortcut to see updates).

## Service worker

Cache name: **`myasset-v92`**. Bump on every `index.html` change.

Strategy:
- Network-first: Supabase API, `index.html` / app root (ensures updates always show)
- Cache-first: CDN assets (Chart.js, Supabase JS)
- Precached: CDN bundles only (not the app shell)

## Mutual Funds — rebuild plan (fresh start, drafted 2026-06-19)

The previous MF implementation was removed because two things kept breaking:
1. **Keying in a new fund threw errors.** Saving a holding was coupled to an external NAV/code lookup. If the SEC API call failed, returned 400, or the fund wasn't found, the save flow surfaced the error. PostgREST also crashed on `.in([null])` when a holding had no `fund_code`.
2. **NAV fetching never worked reliably.** The SEC Open Data v2 API has **no per-fund filter** — finding one fund meant paginating all ~11 500 funds via `?next_cursor=`. The real target fund (KKOREPATH / KKP CorePath Balanced) was not even present in the API, and every scraper fallback (thaifundstoday, finnomena, Morningstar, KKP site) was client-rendered, 404, or IP-blocked from GAS.

### Core principle for the rebuild
**Adding a holding must never call an external API and must never block on NAV.** Saving a fund = a pure DB insert of what the user typed. NAV is a *separate, optional, never-fatal* layer. This alone eliminates the "error when I key in a new fund" class of bugs.

### Recommended approach: manual-NAV-first, automation optional
Treat MF like the bond/private pages — the user owns the numbers; automation is a convenience that can fail silently.

**Phase 1 — holdings + manual NAV (no external calls, ships clean) — ✅ DONE 2026-06-20**
> Built exactly as specced below: migration 014 recreated `mutual_fund_holdings` (insert-only, manual `current_nav_thb`), MF page + add/edit/delete modal + "Update NAV" modal, and `mfUSD`/`mfTHB` re-wired into `calcUserData`, donut `_seg`, "Other" card, `loadMore`, and partner view. Funds with no NAV fall back to cost basis for value and show P/L `—`. (Also fixed a pre-existing bug: `addUSD`/`combUsPort` were referenced but undefined in `loadDashboard`, silently breaking the home 2×2 category cards.) **Migration 014 must be run in Supabase before the page works.**

1. **Migration 014** — recreate tables, simpler than before:
   - `mutual_fund_holdings`: `id, user_id, fund_name NOT NULL, category, units, avg_cost_thb, current_nav_thb (nullable), nav_updated_at (nullable), buy_date, notes, created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()`. **No `fund_code` requirement.** Add the `created_at` column this time.
   - Skip `mutual_fund_master` / `mutual_fund_nav` entirely for Phase 1 — store the latest NAV directly on the holding (`current_nav_thb`). Add a history table only if a 1-day-change badge is actually wanted later.
   - RLS: anon read + anon insert/update/delete (same pattern as `thai_bonds`).
2. **MF page + modal** — add/edit/delete a fund: name, category, units, avg cost, and an editable **Current NAV (THB)** field the user can type. Value = `units × current_nav_thb`. P/L = vs `units × avg_cost_thb`.
3. **Wire back into dashboard/asset-hub** — re-add `mfUSD` to `calcUserData()`, the home donut (`_seg`), the "Other" card, `loadMore()`, and partner view. (Search this file's git history for the removed lines — they show exactly where each `mfUSD`/`mfTHB` line went.)
4. Result: fully working MF tracking with zero error surface, because nothing leaves the browser except Supabase writes.

**Phase 2 — optional automated NAV refresh (additive, never blocks saves) — ✅ DONE 2026-06-20**
> Built with the **SEC Open Data v2** endpoint (validated working): `GET /v2/fund/daily-info/nav?proj_id&start_nav_date&end_nav_date` with `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`. Response is `{ items: [...], next_cursor, page_size }` (not a root array — `items` key fixed in production after confirming with live logs). `last_val` is the NAV/unit. **One proj_id returns several `fund_class_name` variants** (…-ES, …-SSF) with different NAVs, so the user stores both `sec_proj_id` and the exact `sec_fund_class_name`. `refreshMFNav` (daily 8PM trigger `onMFNavTrigger` + manual ↻ button) queries a **14-day window** (covers long SEC publishing lag + Thai holidays), follows `next_cursor` pagination to get all rows, matches the exact class, takes the most recent `nav_date`, and PATCHes `current_nav_thb` + `nav_date` + `nav_updated_at`. Per-holding failures log & skip — never throw, never touch a manual value. **NAV lag is fund-specific** (not just weekends): SEC publishes days after the valuation date; `nav_date` vs `nav_updated_at` makes this visible. Verified ~18.11 THB for KKP CorePath Balanced (`M0209_2554`).

**Phase 2 additions (same session) — ✅ DONE 2026-06-20**
> **SEC fund-name search**: `lookupMFFunds(q)` hits `/v2/fund/general-info/profiles?fund_class_name=` (partial matching confirmed, e.g. "KKP CorePath" → 12 results across 4 funds × 3 classes). Fields: `proj_id`, `fund_class_name`, `proj_name_en`, `comp_name_en` (AMC — note: response has no `amc_name` field; use `comp_name_en`). In the modal, **🔍 Search SEC database** button → tappable result list → tapping auto-fills `sec_proj_id` + `sec_fund_class_name`. GAS action: `mfSearchFunds?q=`.
> **`nav_date` column** (migration 016): stores the SEC valuation date separately from `nav_updated_at` (last-polled timestamp). Hero shows `"checked DD Mon · latest NAV DD Mon"` (newest across funds). Card badge: `🟢 Auto NAV · DD Mon`. Card detail: separate "NAV date (SEC)" + "Last checked" rows. This makes SEC publishing lag visible instead of mysterious.
> **`inputmode="decimal"` sweep**: all 26 money/rate/unit fields now show the numeric pad with a decimal-point key on iOS/Android. `type="text"` fields kept as-is (comma formatter `_numInputFmt` breaks with `type="number"`). Integer-only duration fields left alone.

**NAV staleness fixes — ✅ DONE 2026-06-20 (follow-up)**
> Three bugs caused stale/wrong NAV display:
> 1. **`_secApiItems` only fetched page 1** — SEC paginates with `next_cursor`; a fund with multiple classes over a 14-day window (e.g. 4 classes × 14 days = 56 rows) overflows one page and the newest rows were never seen. Fixed: `_secApiItems` now follows `next_cursor` in a loop (≤10 pages), collecting all rows before returning.
> 2. **7-day window too narrow** — funds where SEC publishing lag exceeds 7 days returned 0 rows and were silently skipped, leaving stale NAV in the DB. Fixed: `refreshMFNav` now uses a **14-day window** (`_bkkDate(14)` → `_bkkDate(0)`).
> 3. **`_fmtShortDate` broke on full ISO timestamps** — `nav_updated_at` is a timestamp (`"2026-06-20T08:15:00Z"`), but the helper appended `T00:00:00` unconditionally, producing an unparseable string → "Last checked" showed "Invalid Date" in the expanded card detail. Fixed: now checks `dateStr.includes('T')` before appending.

- Add a single GAS action `refreshMFNav` run by the daily trigger and a manual "Refresh NAV" button. It updates `current_nav_thb` + `nav_updated_at` and **swallows all errors** (logs only) — a failed refresh never affects the holding or the UI.
- **Pick the NAV source deliberately before coding.** Validate it with a throwaay `UrlFetchApp` test in the GAS IDE first — confirm it returns JSON (not client-rendered HTML) and isn't IP-blocked from Google's servers. Candidates, in rough order of reliability:
  1. **SEC Open Data v2** `GET /v2/fund/daily-info/nav?proj_id={id}` — works *only* if the fund exists in SEC and you have its `proj_id`. Have the **user paste the SEC `proj_id` once** (store on the holding) instead of paginating 11 500 funds to discover it. Confirm the held funds are actually in SEC first.
  2. **AMC / settrade / wealthmagik JSON endpoints** — check whether the specific AMCs (e.g. KKP) expose a JSON NAV endpoint.
  3. **Manual only** — if no reliable source exists for a given fund, leave it manual. That's an acceptable end state, not a failure.
- Do **not** reintroduce: blind pagination of the whole SEC catalogue, name→code fuzzy matching, or HTML scraping of Next.js client-rendered pages. Those were the unreliable parts.

### Hard rules carried over from the failure
- `getLatestPrice()` / any `.in(...)` PostgREST query must filter out null ids **before** the call.
- The "Add Fund" button must never `await` a GAS call. Save first, return to the list, *then* (optionally) kick a fire-and-forget refresh.
- Every external fetch in GAS uses `muteHttpExceptions: true` and is wrapped so it can only log, never throw into a user path.

### Deploy steps when implementing
1. Run migration 014 in Supabase SQL editor (save the file to `supabase/migrations/` first).
2. Build the page following `skills/add-asset-page.md`.
3. If doing Phase 2, paste updated GAS into the Apps Script IDE and redeploy the Web App (see `skills/deploy-gas.md`).
4. Bump `sw.js` cache version.
